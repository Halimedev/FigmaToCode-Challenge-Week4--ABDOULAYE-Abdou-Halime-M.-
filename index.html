                            development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing 
                            the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User 
                            experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly 
                            performant code matters to me.</p>
                            <p>I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've 
                            continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges 
                            and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early 
                            thirties, 7 years after starting my web development journey, I'm building 
                            cutting edge web applications using modern technologies such as 
                            Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.</p>
                           <p> When I'm not in full on developer mode, you can find me hovering 
                            around on twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the journey of early 
                            startups or enjoying some free time. You can follow me on Twitter where 
                            I share tech related bites and build in public, or you can follow me on

                      <div class="abouttxt">
                        <p>I'm a passionate, self proclaimed designer who specializes in full stack 
                            development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing 
                            the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User 
                            experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly 
                            performant code matters to me.</p>
                            <p>I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've 
                            continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges 
                            and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early 
                            thirties, 7 years after starting my web development journey, I'm building 
                            cutting edge web applications using modern technologies such as 
                            Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.</p>
                           <p> When I'm not in full on developer mode, you can find me hovering 
                            around on twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the journey of early 
                            startups or enjoying some free time. You can follow me on Twitter where 
                            I share tech related bites and build in public, or you can follow me on 
                            GitHub</p>
